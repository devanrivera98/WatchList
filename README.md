# WatchList

A front end web application that allows the user to search up a movie/tv show and add it to their list of entertainment they want to watch.

## Why I Built This

As a movie lover, I got inspired to create an app that helps me remember which movies or shows I want to watch. With this app, I no longer have to struggle to recall their titles because I can keep track of them easily. It's a simple and convenient way to manage my movie-watching goals.
