# WatchList

A front end web application that allows users to search for movies or television show and add them to their list of entertainment they want to watch.

## Why I Built This

As a movie lover, I was inspired to create an app that helps me remember which movies or shows I want to watch. With this app, I no longer struggle to recall their titles because I can easily keep track of them. It provides a simple and convenient way to manage my movie-watching goals.
